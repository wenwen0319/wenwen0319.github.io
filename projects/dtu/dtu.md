We designed and implemented a DTU with bluetooth for Shanghai LiveSine Cooperation.
* Designed the DTU and add a BLE to it. 
* Designed an APP which can communicate with DTU by bluetooth protocol and with the server by TCP/IP protocol (using Delphi)
* Made sure that the communication will not be influenced by the electromagnetic field created by the strong direct current
* Designed the communication protocol based on MODBUS protocol.
* Interpreted the data from DTU and showed them in a friendly user interface.
* Test in a real situation.
