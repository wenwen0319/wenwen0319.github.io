# [Generative Multi View Human Action Recognition](https://github.com/wanglichenxj/Generative-Multi-View-Human-Action-Recognition)

We implemented a generative model to fully utilize the pair-wise information in different views. Our model can handle complete view, partial view and missing view at the same time. We also proposed a simple yet effective View Correlation Discovery Network to do the label-level fusion.

# [Password Analysis and Dictionary Attack](https://wenwen0319.github.io/GENPass/)

We analyzed several leaked password datasets and used machine learning to create a more general password dictionary.

# [Acedemic Network](https://wenwen0319.github.io/acenet/)

I analyzed the relationship of topics and authors using some algorithms.

# [DTU with Bluetooth](https://wenwen0319.github.io/dtu/)

Traditional DTUs do not have bluetooth. To make it easier to use, we implemented a bluetooth part in it.

# [Evil Twin](https://wenwen0319.github.io/eviltwin/)

We proposed several methods to defend Evil Twin.
