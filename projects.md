I have done several projects about Iot, Wireless Network, Security, Machine Learning and Computer Vision.

# Project 1 [Evil Twin](https://wenwen0319.github.io/eviltwin/)

We proposed several methods to defend Evil Twin.

# Project 2 [DTU with Bluetooth](https://wenwen0319.github.io/dtu/)

Traditional DTUs do not have bluetooth. To make it easier to use, we implement a bluetooth part in it.

# Project 3 [Acedemic Network](https://wenwen0319.github.io/acenet/)

I analyzed the relationship of topics and authors using some algorithms.

# Project 4 [Password Analysis and Dictionary Attack](https://wenwen0319.github.io/GENPass/)

We analyzed several leaked password datasets and used machine learning to create a more general password dictionary.
