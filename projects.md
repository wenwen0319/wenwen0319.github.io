# [Terrain Generation](https://wenwen0319.github.io/projects/Terrain/terrain/)

Generate Terrain using a single 128*128 image.

# [Equivariant Hypergraph Diffusion Neural Operators](https://github.com/Graph-COM/ED-HNN)

In this work, we are inspired by hypergraph diffusion algorithms and design a novel HNN architecture that holds provable expressiveness while keeping efficiency. 

# [Neural Higher-order Pattern (Motif) Prediction in Temporal Networks](https://github.com/Graph-COM/Neural_Higher-order_Pattern_Prediction)

Dynamic systems that consist of a set of interacting elements can be abstracted as temporal networks. Recently, higher-order patterns that involve multiple interacting nodes have been found crucial to indicate domain-specific laws of different temporal networks. Here, we propose the first model, named HIT, for higher-order pattern prediction in temporal hypergraphs. Particularly, we focus on predicting three types of common but important interaction patterns involving three interacting elements in temporal networks, which could be extended to even higher-order patterns. 

# [Inductive Representation Learning in Temporal Networks via Causal Anonymous Walks](https://snap.stanford.edu/caw/)

We introduce Causal Anonymous Walks (CAW) for inductive representation learning in temporal networks. CAWs are extracted by temporal random walks and work as automatic retrieval of temporal network motifs to represent network dynamics, while avoiding the time-consuming selection and counting of those motifs. 

<!-- # [Semi-supervised Multi-view Learning](https://wenwen0319.github.io/projects/Semi_supervised_Multi_view/main/)

We try to combine semi-supervised learning and multi-view learning together. This work is still ongoing. -->

# [Semi-supervised Multi-label Learning](https://wenwen0319.github.io/projects/Semi_supervised_Multi_label/Semi_supervised_Multi_label/)

We proposed a method which jointly explores the inter-instance feature distribution and intra-instance label relation simultaneously. We also applied co-training with pseudo labels to further improve learning performance. A relation network is further proposed to explore the cross-label relation knowledge. 

# [Generative Multi View Human Action Recognition](https://github.com/wanglichenxj/Generative-Multi-View-Human-Action-Recognition)

We implemented a generative model to fully utilize the pair-wise information in different views. Our model can handle complete view, partial view and missing view at the same time. We also proposed a simple yet effective View Correlation Discovery Network to do the label-level fusion.

# [Action Recognition based on EMG signal](https://wenwen0319.github.io/projects/EMG/EMG/)

EMG stands for electromyography. It is the study of muscle electrical signals. Since EMG signal always contains noise, conventional methods use Root Mean Square(RMS) to reduce the noise and extract feature. However the RMS misses a lot of useful information. To reduce the dimension and avoid shifting in the signal, LDA and PCA are utilized. Traditional machine learning methods are implemented for the classification, including Random Forest, KNN, SVM. These methods lack a unified and principled objective function. Therefore, we proposed a method using Fast Fourier Transform(FFT) to extract the features. And then applied a LSTM model to do the classification. Our result is better than the previous traditional methods.

# [Password Analysis and Dictionary Attack](https://wenwen0319.github.io/projects/GENPass/GENPass/)

We analyzed several leaked password datasets and used machine learning to create a more general password dictionary.

# [Acedemic Network](https://wenwen0319.github.io/projects/acenet/acenet/)

I analyzed the relationship of topics and authors using some algorithms.

# [DTU with Bluetooth](https://wenwen0319.github.io/projects/dtu/dtu/)

Traditional DTUs do not have bluetooth. To make it easier to use, we implemented a bluetooth part in it.

# [Evil Twin](https://wenwen0319.github.io/projects/eviltwin/eviltwin/)

We proposed several methods to defend Evil Twin.
