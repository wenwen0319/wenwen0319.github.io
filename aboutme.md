My name is Yunyu Liu. I am now a master student at Northeastern University. Before that, I obtained my Bachelor degree at Shanghai Jiao Tong University(2014-2018). I am interested in machine learning and computer vision in general. To be specific, I focused on multi-view learning, human motion and semi-supervised learning. Recently, I'm interested in Graph Neural Network, e.g., Graph Convolutional Network(GCN), GraphSage, Structure2Vec and so on. During my undergraduate study, I conducted several researches on Wireless Network and Network Security using machine learning methods, including password analysis and dictionray attack and Evil Twin Detection. My dissertation for bachelor's degree is about academic network. It visaulized the topic relation in computer science field. Besides, some frequent patterns are found. This study may help people know which topic may be hot topics in the following years. Here is my [CV](http://wenwen0319.github.io/Resume.pdf).
